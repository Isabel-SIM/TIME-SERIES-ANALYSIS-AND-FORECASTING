# Mercado Libre Growth Analysis

## Background
As a growth analyst at Mercado Libre, I was tasked with analysing the company's financial and user data to identify clever ways to drive revenue and help the company grow. This project involves creating a Jupyter notebook that contains data preparation, analysis, and visualisations for various time series data critical for the company's understanding. The main objectives are:

1. Visual depictions of seasonality, measured by Google Search traffic, to address company interests.
2. An evaluation of the correlation between the company's stock price and Google Search traffic.
3. Building a Prophet forecast model for predicting hourly user search traffic.
4. Answering key questions related to the project instructions.
5. (Optional) Creating a revenue forecast plot for the company's future.

## Requirements
Ensure that you have the following libraries and packages installed with the specified versions to run the code:

- Pandas 1.2.4
- hvPlot 0.7.3
- scikit-learn 0.24.1
- matplotlib 3.3.4
- holoviews 1.14.6
- bokeh 2.2.3
- fbprophet 0.7.1

You can install these libraries using pip if they are not already installed.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions.
3. Execute the code cells in the notebook to perform the analysis.

## Summary
This project involves extensive time series analysis, including identifying patterns, mining seasonality, and building predictive models using the Prophet framework. The results provide valuable insights into search traffic patterns and their impact on the company's financial performance.

For a comprehensive analysis and detailed visualisations, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook.
