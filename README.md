This repository contains the code and analysis for forecasting search traffic and stock price patterns at MercadoLibre, the leading e-commerce site in Latin America. Through my analysis, I have accomplished the following tasks:<br><br>
  - <b>Unearthing Unusual Patterns:</b><br> By examining hourly Google search traffic, specifically during the month of May 2020 when MercadoLibre released its financial results, I identified intriguing patterns. Notably, search traffic significant spikes and what important corporate events they coincided with.<br>
  - <b>Unveiling Seasonal Secrets:</b><br> Mining the search traffic data, I uncovered seasonal patterns tied to the day of the week and specific hours. Additionally, I observed and analysed the surges in search traffic - revealing the influence of seasonal trends.<br>
  - <b>Unraveling Correlations:</b><br> In collaboration with the finance group, I explored the relationship between search traffic and stock price patterns. The analysis revealed a compelling correlation between search traffic and stock volatility, as well as stock price returns. <br>
  - <b>Unleashing Prophet's Power:</b><br> Leveraging the Prophet forecasting model, I built a time series model to predict search traffic popularity. The model's forecasts provided valuable insights into future trends and growth opportunities for MercadoLibre. <br>
